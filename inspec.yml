### INPUTS ###
# Inputs are variables that can be referenced by any control in the profile, 
# and are defined and given a default value in this file.

# By default, each parameter is set to exactly comply with the STIG baseline
# wherever possible. Some STIG controls will require you to update an input
# to provide the profile with necessary context for your system.

# For example, control SV-230379 checks that only 'necessary accounts' exist
# on the system. The list of 'necessary' accounts depends on the function of
# the system, and you will likely need to add approved accounts to the 
# 'known_system_accounts' input. Also, depending on your local organizational
# security policy, you may need to deviate from the STIG on some controls to
# make the test profile 'stricter' or 'looser.'

# In both cases, you can override the default values given in this file
# using an input file or a CLI flag at execution time. See InSpec's Inputs docs
# at https://docs.chef.io/inspec/profiles/inputs/ for details.

# NOTE: DO NOT directly change the default values by editing this file. Use
# overrides instead.
