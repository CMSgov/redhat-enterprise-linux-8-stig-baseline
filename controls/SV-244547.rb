    Peripherals include, but are not limited to, such devices as flash drives,
external storage, and printers.
    A new feature that RHEL 8 provides is the USBGuard software framework. The
USBguard-daemon is the main component of the USBGuard software framework. It
runs as a service in the background and enforces the USB device authorization
policy for all USB devices. The policy is defined by a set of rules using a
rule language described in the usbguard-rules.conf file. The policy and the
authorization state of USB devices can be modified during runtime using the
usbguard tool.

    The System Administrator (SA) must work with the site Information System
Security Officer (ISSO) to determine a list of authorized peripherals and
establish rules within the USBGuard software framework to allow only authorized
devices.'
