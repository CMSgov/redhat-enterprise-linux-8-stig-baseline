  desc  "Configuring the operating system to implement organization-wide
security implementation guides and security checklists verifies compliance with
federal standards and establishes a common security baseline across the DoD
that reflects the most restrictive security posture consistent with operational
requirements.

    Configuration settings are the set of parameters that can be changed in
hardware, software, or firmware components of the system that affect the
security posture and/or functionality of the system. Security-related
parameters are those parameters impacting the security state of the system,
including the parameters required to satisfy other security control
requirements. Security-related parameters include, for example, registry
settings; account, file, and directory permission settings; and settings for
functions, ports, protocols, services, and remote connections.

    Verify the operating system enforces a delay of at least four seconds
between console logon prompts following a failed logon attempt with the
following command:

    $ sudo grep -i fail_delay /etc/login.defs

    FAIL_DELAY 4

    If the value of \"FAIL_DELAY\" is not set to \"4\" or greater, or the line
is commented out, this is a finding.

    Configure the operating system to enforce a delay of at least four seconds
between logon prompts following a failed console logon attempt.

    Modify the \"/etc/login.defs\" file to set the \"FAIL_DELAY\" parameter to
\"4\" or greater:
