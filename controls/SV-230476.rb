  desc 'To ensure RHEL 8 systems have a sufficient storage capacity in which
to write the audit logs, RHEL 8 needs to be able to allocate audit record
storage capacity.

    The task of allocating audit record storage capacity is usually performed
during initial installation of RHEL 8.'
  desc 'check', 'Verify RHEL 8 allocates audit record storage capacity to store at least one week of audit records when audit records are not immediately sent to a central audit record storage facility.

Determine to which partition the audit records are being written with the following command:

$ sudo grep -iw log_file /etc/audit/auditd.conf
log_file = /var/log/audit/audit.log

Check the size of the partition to which audit records are written (with the example being /var/log/audit/) with the following command:

$ sudo df -h /var/log/audit/
/dev/sda2 24G 10.4G 13.6G 43% /var/log/audit

If the audit records are not written to a partition made specifically for audit records (/var/log/audit is a separate partition), determine the amount of space being used by other files in the partition with the following command:

$ sudo du -sh [audit_partition]
1.8G /var/log/audit

If the audit record partition is not allocated for sufficient storage capacity, this is a finding.

Note: The partition size needed to capture a week of audit records is based on the activity level of the system and the total storage capacity available. Typically 10.0 GB of storage space for audit records should be sufficient.'

when audit records are not immediately sent to a central audit record storage
facility.

    If audit records are stored on a partition made specifically for audit
records, resize the partition with sufficient space to contain one week of
audit records.

    If audit records are not stored on a partition made specifically for audit
records, a new partition with sufficient space will need be to be created.'
