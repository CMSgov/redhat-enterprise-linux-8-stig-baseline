    Verify that RHEL 8 enforces a 60-day maximum password lifetime for new user
accounts by running the following command:

    $ sudo grep -i pass_max_days /etc/login.defs
    PASS_MAX_DAYS 60

    If the \"PASS_MAX_DAYS\" parameter value is greater than \"60\", or
commented out, this is a finding.

    Configure RHEL 8 to enforce a 60-day maximum password lifetime.
