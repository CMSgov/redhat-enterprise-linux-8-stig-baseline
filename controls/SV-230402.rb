configuration data to attackers, thus compromising its confidentiality.

    Audit information includes all information (e.g., audit records, audit
settings, audit reports) needed to successfully audit RHEL 8 system activity.

    In immutable mode, unauthorized users cannot execute changes to the audit
system to potentially hide malicious activity and then put the audit rules
back.  A system reboot would be noticeable and a system administrator could
then investigate the unauthorized changes.'

option to the "/etc/audit/audit.rules", this is a finding.'

is recommended to add this option as the last step in securing the system.'
