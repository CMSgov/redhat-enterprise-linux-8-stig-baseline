  desc 'Preventing unauthorized information transfers mitigates the risk of
information, including encrypted representations of information, produced by
the actions of prior users/roles (or the actions of processes acting on behalf
of prior users/roles) from being available to any current users/roles (or
current processes) that obtain access to shared system resources (e.g.,
registers, main memory, hard disks) after those resources have been released
back to information systems. The control of information in shared resources is
also commonly referred to as object reuse and residual information protection.

    This requirement generally applies to the design of an information
technology product, but it can also apply to the configuration of particular
information system components that are, or use, such products. This can be
verified by acceptance/validation processes in DoD or other government agencies.

    There may be shared resources with configurable protections (e.g., files in
storage) that may be assessed on specific information system components.'

Check to see that all world-writable directories have the sticky bit set by running the following command:

$ sudo find / -type d \\( -perm -0002 -a ! -perm -1000 \\) -print 2>/dev/null

drwxrwxrwt 7 root root 4096 Jul 26 11:19 /tmp

If any of the returned directories are world-writable and do not have the sticky bit set, this is a finding.'
