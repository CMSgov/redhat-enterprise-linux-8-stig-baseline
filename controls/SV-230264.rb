the integrity of the patch or upgrade received from a vendor. This verifies the
software has not been tampered with and that it has been provided by a trusted

    Check that YUM verifies the signature of packages from a repository prior
to install with the following command:

    $ sudo egrep '^\[.*\]|gpgcheck' /etc/yum.repos.d/*.repo

    If "gpgcheck" is not set to "1", or if options are missing or commented
out, ask the System Administrator how the certificates for patches and other
operating system components are verified.

    If there is no process to validate certificates that is approved by the
organization, this is a finding.)
