    Off-loading is a common process in information systems with limited audit
storage capacity.

    RHEL 8 installation media provides "rsyslogd".  "rsyslogd" is a system
utility providing support for message logging.  Support for both internet and
UNIX domain sockets enables this utility to support both local and remote
logging.  Couple this utility with "gnutls" (which is a secure communications
library implementing the SSL, TLS and DTLS protocols), and you have a method to
securely encrypt and off-load auditing.'

    If the value of the "overflow_action" option is not set to "syslog",
"single", "halt", or the line is commented out, ask the System
Administrator to indicate how the audit logs are off-loaded to a different

off-loaded to another system or media takes appropriate action if the internal
event queue becomes full, this is a finding.'
