default, functionality exceeding requirements or mission objectives. These
unnecessary capabilities or services are often overlooked and therefore may
remain unsecured. They increase the risk to the platform by providing
additional attack vectors.

    A core dump includes a memory image taken at the time the operating system
terminates an application. The memory image could contain sensitive data and is
generally useful only for developers trying to debug problems.'

differently for multiple domains.

other than "0" and the need for core dumps is not documented with the
Information System Security Officer (ISSO) as an operational requirement for
all domains that have the "core" item assigned, this is a finding.)
