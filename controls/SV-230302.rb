  desc 'The "noexec" mount option causes the system not to execute binary
files. This option must be used for mounting any file system not containing
approved binary files, as they may be incompatible. Executing files from

    Note: If a separate file system has not been created for the user home
directories (user home directories are mounted under "/"), this is
automatically a finding as the "noexec" option cannot be used on the "/"
system.

    Find the file system(s) that contain the user home directories with the
following command:

    $ sudo awk -F: '($3>=1000)&&($7 !~ /nologin/){print $1,$3,$6}' /etc/passwd

    robinst:1002: /home/robinst

command:

    $ sudo more /etc/fstab

rw,relatime,discard,data=ordered,nosuid,nodev,noexec 0 2

    If a file system found in "/etc/fstab" refers to the user home directory
file system and it does not have the "noexec" option set, this is a finding.)
