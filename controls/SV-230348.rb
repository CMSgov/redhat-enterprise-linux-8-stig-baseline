  desc 'A session lock is a temporary action taken when a user stops work and
moves away from the immediate physical vicinity of the information system but
does not want to log out because of the temporary nature of the absence.

    The session lock is implemented at the point where session activity can be
determined. Rather than be forced to wait for a period of time to expire before
the user session can be locked, RHEL 8 needs to provide users with the ability
to manually invoke a session lock so users can secure their session if it is
necessary to temporarily vacate the immediate physical vicinity.

    Tmux is a terminal multiplexer that enables a number of terminals to be
created, accessed, and controlled from a single screen.  Red Hat endorses tmux
as the recommended session controlling package.'

This configuration binds the uppercase letter "X" to manually initiate a session lock after the prefix key "Ctrl + b" has been sent. The complete key sequence is thus "Ctrl + b" then "Shift + x" to lock tmux.

Create a global configuration file "/etc/tmux.conf" and add the following lines:

Reload tmux configuration to take effect. This can be performed in tmux while it is running:
