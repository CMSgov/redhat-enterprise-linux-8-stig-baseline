  desc %q(ICMP redirect messages are used by routers to inform hosts that a more
direct route exists for a particular destination. These messages contain
information from the system's route table, possibly revealing portions of the
network topology.

    There are notable differences between Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4)
and Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6). There is only a directive to disable
sending of IPv4 redirected packets. Refer to RFC4294 for an explanation of
"IPv6 Node Requirements", which resulted in this difference between IPv4 and
IPv6.)
