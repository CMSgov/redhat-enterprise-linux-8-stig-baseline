console, can reboot the system. If accidentally pressed, as could happen in the
case of a mixed OS environment, this can create the risk of short-term loss of
availability of systems due to unintentional reboot. In a graphical user
environment, risk of unintentional reboot from the Ctrl-Alt-Delete sequence is
reduced because the user will be prompted before any action is taken.'
