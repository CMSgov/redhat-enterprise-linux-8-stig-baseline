  desc  "A locally logged-on user, who presses Ctrl-Alt-Delete when at the
console, can reboot the system. If accidentally pressed, as could happen in the
case of a mixed OS environment, this can create the risk of short-term loss of
availability of systems due to unintentional reboot. In a graphical user
environment, risk of unintentional reboot from the Ctrl-Alt-Delete sequence is
reduced because the user will be prompted before any action is taken."

    Verify RHEL 8 is not configured to reboot the system when Ctrl-Alt-Delete
is pressed with the following command:

    $ sudo systemctl status ctrl-alt-del.target

    ctrl-alt-del.target
    Loaded: masked (Reason: Unit ctrl-alt-del.target is masked.)
    Active: inactive (dead)

    If the \"ctrl-alt-del.target\" is loaded and not masked, this is a finding.

    Configure the system to disable the Ctrl-Alt-Delete sequence for the
command line with the following command:

    $ sudo systemctl mask ctrl-alt-del.target

    Reload the daemon for this change to take effect.
