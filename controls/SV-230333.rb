  title "RHEL 8 must automatically lock an account when three unsuccessful
logon attempts occur."
  desc  "By limiting the number of failed logon attempts, the risk of
unauthorized system access via user password guessing, otherwise known as
brute-force attacks, is reduced. Limits are imposed by locking the account.

    In RHEL 8.2 the \"/etc/security/faillock.conf\" file was incorporated to
centralize the configuration of the pam_faillock.so module.  Also introduced is
a \"local_users_only\" option that will only track failed user authentication
attempts for local users in /etc/passwd and ignore centralized (AD, IdM, LDAP,
etc.) users to allow the centralized platform to solely manage user lockout.

    From \"faillock.conf\" man pages: Note that the default directory that
\"pam_faillock\" uses is usually cleared on system boot so the access will be
reenabled after system reboot. If that is undesirable a different tally
directory must be set with the \"dir\" option.

    Note: This check applies to RHEL versions 8.2 or newer, if the system is
RHEL version 8.0 or 8.1, this check is not applicable.

    Verify the \"/etc/security/faillock.conf\" file is configured to lock an
account after three unsuccessful logon attempts:

    $ sudo grep 'deny =' /etc/security/faillock.conf

    deny = 3

    If the \"deny\" option is not set to \"3\" or less (but not \"0\"), is
missing or commented out, this is a finding.
