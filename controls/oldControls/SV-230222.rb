  desc 'Timely patching is critical for maintaining the operational
    availability, confidentiality, and integrity of information technology (IT)
    systems. However, failure to keep operating system and application software
    patched is a common mistake made by IT professionals. New patches are released
    daily, and it is often difficult for even experienced System Administrators to
    keep abreast of all the new patches. When new weaknesses in an operating system
    exist, patches are usually made available by the vendor to resolve the
    problems. If the most recent security patches and updates are not installed,
    unauthorized users may take advantage of weaknesses in the unpatched software.
    The lack of prompt attention to patching could result in a system compromise.'

    Obtain the list of available package security updates from Red Hat. The URL
    for updates is https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/. It is important to note that
    updates provided by Red Hat may not be present on the system if the underlying
    packages are not installed.

    Check that the available package security updates have been installed on
    the system with the following command:

        $ sudo yum history list | more

    If package updates have not been performed on the system within the
    timeframe the site/program documentation requires, this is a finding.

    Typical update frequency may be overridden by Information Assurance
    Vulnerability Alert (IAVA) notifications from CYBERCOM.

    If the operating system is in non-compliance with the Information Assurance
    Vulnerability Management (IAVM) process, this is a finding.'
