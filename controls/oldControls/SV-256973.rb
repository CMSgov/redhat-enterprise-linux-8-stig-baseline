  desc 'Cryptographic verification of vendor software packages ensures that all software packages are obtained from a valid source and protects against spoofing that could lead to installation of malware on the system. Red Hat cryptographically signs all software packages, which includes updates, with a GPG key to verify that they are valid.'
  desc 'check', 'Confirm Red Hat package-signing keys are installed on the system and verify their fingerprints match vendor values.

Note: For RHEL 8 software packages, Red Hat uses GPG keys labeled "release key 2" and "auxiliary key 2". The keys are defined in key file "/etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-redhat-release" by default.

List Red Hat GPG keys installed on the system:

     $ sudo rpm -q --queryformat "%{SUMMARY}\\n" gpg-pubkey | grep -i "red hat"

     gpg(Red Hat, Inc. (release key 2) <security@redhat.com>)
     gpg(Red Hat, Inc. (auxiliary key) <security@redhat.com>)

If Red Hat GPG keys "release key 2" and "auxiliary key 2" are not installed, this is a finding.

Note: The "auxiliary key 2" appears as "auxiliary key" on a RHEL 8 system.

List key fingerprints of installed Red Hat GPG keys:

     $ sudo gpg -q --keyid-format short --with-fingerprint /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-redhat-release

If key file "/etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-redhat-release" is missing, this is a finding.

Compare key fingerprints of installed Red Hat GPG keys with fingerprints listed for RHEL 8 on Red Hat "Product Signing Keys" webpage at https://access.redhat.com/security/team/key.

If key fingerprints do not match, this is a finding.'
  desc 'fix', 'Install Red Hat package-signing keys on the system and verify their fingerprints match vendor values.

Insert RHEL 8 installation disc or attach RHEL 8 installation image to the system. Mount the disc or image to make the contents accessible inside the system.

Assuming the mounted location is "/media/cdrom", use the following command to copy Red Hat GPG key file onto the system:

     $ sudo cp /media/cdrom/RPM-GPG-KEY-redhat-release /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/

Import Red Hat GPG keys from key file into system keyring:

     $ sudo rpm --import /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-redhat-release

Using the steps listed in the Check Text, confirm the newly imported keys show as installed on the system and verify their fingerprints match vendor values.'
