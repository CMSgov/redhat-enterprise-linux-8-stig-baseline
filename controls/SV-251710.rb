        Security function is defined as the hardware, software, and/or firmware of the information system responsible for enforcing the
        system security policy and supporting the isolation of code and data on which the protection is based. Security functionality
        includes, but is not limited to, establishing system accounts, configuring access authorizations (i.e., permissions, privileges),
        setting events to be audited, and setting intrusion detection parameters.
