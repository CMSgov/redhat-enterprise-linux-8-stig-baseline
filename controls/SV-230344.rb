  title "RHEL 8 must include root when automatically locking an account until
the locked account is released by an administrator when #{input('unsuccessful_atempts')} unsuccessful
logon attempts occur during a #{input('fail_interval_mins')}-minute time period."
  desc  "By limiting the number of failed logon attempts, the risk of
unauthorized system access via user password guessing, otherwise known as
brute-force attacks, is reduced. Limits are imposed by locking the account.

    RHEL 8 can utilize the \"pam_faillock.so\" for this purpose. Note that
manual changes to the listed files may be overwritten by the \"authselect\"
program.

    From \"Pam_Faillock\" man pages: Note that the default directory that
\"pam_faillock\" uses is usually cleared on system boot so the access will be
reenabled after system reboot. If that is undesirable a different tally
directory must be set with the \"dir\" option.

    In RHEL 8.2 the \"/etc/security/faillock.conf\" file was incorporated to
centralize the configuration of the pam_faillock.so module. Also introduced is
a \"local_users_only\" option that will only track failed user authentication
attempts for local users in /etc/passwd and ignore centralized (AD, IdM, LDAP,
etc.) users to allow the centralized platform to solely manage user lockout.

    Check that the system includes the root account when locking an account
after #{input('unsuccessful_atempts')} unsuccessful logon attempts within a period of #{input('fail_interval_mins')} minutes with the
following commands:

    If the system is RHEL version 8.2 or newer, this check is not applicable.

    Note: If the System Administrator demonstrates the use of an approved
centralized account management method that locks an account after #{input('unsuccessful_atempts')}
unsuccessful logon attempts within a period of #{input('fail_interval_mins')} minutes, this requirement is
not applicable.

    If the \"even_deny_root\" option is missing from the \"preauth\" line with
the \"pam_faillock.so\" module, this is a finding.

    Configure the operating system to include root when locking an account
after #{input('unsuccessful_atempts')} unsuccessful logon attempts occur in #{input('fail_interval_mins')} minutes.
