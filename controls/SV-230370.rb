combinations that need to be tested before the password is compromised.

    Password complexity, or strength, is a measure of the effectiveness of a
password in resisting attempts at guessing and brute-force attacks. Password
length is one factor of several that helps to determine strength and how long
it takes to crack a password. Use of more characters in a password helps to
increase exponentially the time and/or resources required to compromise the
password.

    The DoD minimum password requirement is 15 characters."
