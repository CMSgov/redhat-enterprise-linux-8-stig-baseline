  desc 'It is detrimental for operating systems to provide, or install by
default, functionality exceeding requirements or mission objectives. These
unnecessary capabilities or services are often overlooked and therefore may
remain unsecured. They increase the risk to the platform by providing
additional attack vectors.

    A core dump includes a memory image taken at the time the operating system
terminates an application. The memory image could contain sensitive data and is
generally useful only for developers trying to debug problems.

    When the kernel invokes systemd-coredumpt to handle a core dump, it runs in
privileged mode, and will connect to the socket created by the
systemd-coredump.socket unit. This, in turn,  will spawn an unprivileged
systemd-coredump@.service instance to process the core dump.'
  desc 'check', 'Verify RHEL 8 is not configured to acquire, save, or process core dumps with the following command:

$ sudo systemctl status systemd-coredump.socket

systemd-coredump.socket
Loaded: masked (Reason: Unit systemd-coredump.socket is masked.)
Active: inactive (dead)

If the "systemd-coredump.socket" is loaded and not masked and the need for core dumps is not documented with the Information System Security Officer (ISSO) as an operational requirement, this is a finding.'
