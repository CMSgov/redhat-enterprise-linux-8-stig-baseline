notification verbiage used is consistent with applicable federal laws,

    System use notifications are required only for access via logon interfaces
with human users and are not required when such human interfaces do not exist.

    The banner must be formatted in accordance with applicable #{input('org_name')[:acronym]} policy. Use
the following verbiage for operating systems that can accommodate banners of
1300 characters:

    \"#{input('banner_message_text_ral')}\"

    Use the following verbiage for operating systems that have severe
limitations on the number of characters that can be displayed in the banner:

    \"I've read and consent to terms in IS user agreem't.\"

    Verify any publicly accessible connection to the operating system displays
the Standard Mandatory #{input('org_name')[:acronym]} Notice and Consent Banner before granting access to
the system.

    Check for the location of the banner file being used with the following
command:

    $ sudo grep -i banner /etc/ssh/sshd_config

    banner /etc/issue

    This command will return the banner keyword and the name of the file that
contains the ssh banner (in this case \"/etc/issue\").

    If the line is commented out, this is a finding.

    View the file specified by the banner keyword to check that it matches the
text of the Standard Mandatory #{input('org_name')[:acronym]} Notice and Consent Banner:

    \"#{input('banner_message_text_ral')}\"

    If the system does not display a graphical logon banner or the banner does
not match the Standard Mandatory #{input('org_name')[:acronym]} Notice and Consent Banner, this is a
finding.

    If the text in the file does not match the Standard Mandatory #{input('org_name')[:acronym]} Notice
and Consent Banner, this is a finding.
  "
  desc 'fix', "
    Configure the operating system to display the Standard Mandatory #{input('org_name')[:acronym]} Notice
and Consent Banner before granting access to the system via the ssh.

    Edit the \"/etc/ssh/sshd_config\" file to uncomment the banner keyword and
configure it to point to a file that will contain the logon banner (this file
may be named differently or be in a different location if using a version of
SSH that is provided by a third-party vendor). An example configuration line is:

    banner /etc/issue

    Either create the file containing the banner or replace the text in the
file with the Standard Mandatory #{input('org_name')[:acronym]} Notice and Consent Banner. The
#{input('org_name')[:acronym]}-required text is:

    \"#{input('banner_message_text_ral')}\"

    The SSH service must be restarted for changes to take effect.
