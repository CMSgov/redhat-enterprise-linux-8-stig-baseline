  desc 'To prevent unauthorized connection of devices, unauthorized transfer
of information, or unauthorized tunneling (i.e., embedding of data types within
data types), organizations must disable or restrict unused or unnecessary
physical and logical ports/protocols on information systems.

    Operating systems are capable of providing a wide variety of functions and
services. Some of the functions and services provided by default may not be
necessary to support essential organizational operations. Additionally, it is
sometimes convenient to provide multiple services from a single component
(e.g., VPN and IPS); however, doing so increases risk over limiting the
services provided by any one component.

    To support the requirements and principles of least functionality, the
operating system must support the organizational requirements, providing only
essential capabilities and limiting the use of ports, protocols, and/or
services to only those required, authorized, and approved to conduct official
business or to address authorized quality-of-life issues.'
