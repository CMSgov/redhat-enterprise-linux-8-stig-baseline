standard method for protecting passwords. If passwords are not encrypted, they
can be plainly read (i.e., clear text) and easily compromised.

    Unapproved mechanisms that are used for authentication to the cryptographic
module are not verified and therefore cannot be relied upon to provide
confidentiality or integrity, and DoD data may be compromised.

access cryptographic modules utilize authentication that meets DoD requirements.

    Verify that the shadow password suite configuration is set to encrypt
password with a FIPS 140-2 approved cryptographic hashing algorithm.

    Check the hashing algorithm that is being used to hash passwords with the
following command:

    $ sudo grep -i crypt /etc/login.defs

    ENCRYPT_METHOD SHA512

    If \"ENCRYPT_METHOD\" does not equal SHA512 or greater, this is a finding.
