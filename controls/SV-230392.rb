  title "The RHEL 8 audit system must take appropriate action when the audit
storage volume is full."
  desc "It is critical that when RHEL 8 is at risk of failing to process audit
logs as required, it takes action to mitigate the failure. Audit processing
failures include software/hardware errors; failures in the audit capturing
mechanisms; and audit storage capacity being reached or exceeded. Responses to
audit failure depend upon the nature of the failure mode.

    When availability is an overriding concern, other approved actions in
response to an audit failure are as follows:

    1) If the failure was caused by the lack of audit record storage capacity,
RHEL 8 must continue generating audit records if possible (automatically
restarting the audit service if necessary) and overwriting the oldest audit
records in a first-in-first-out manner.

    2) If audit records are sent to a centralized collection server and
communication with this server is lost or the server fails, RHEL 8 must queue
audit records locally until communication is restored or until the audit
records are retrieved manually. Upon restoration of the connection to the
centralized collection server, action should be taken to synchronize the local
audit data with the collection server."
  desc 'check', 'Verify RHEL 8 takes the appropriate action when the audit storage volume is
full.

    Check that RHEL 8 takes the appropriate action when the audit storage
volume is full with the following command:

    $ sudo grep disk_full_action /etc/audit/auditd.conf

    disk_full_action = HALT

    If the value of the "disk_full_action" option is not "SYSLOG",
"SINGLE", or "HALT", or the line is commented out, ask the system
administrator to indicate how the system takes appropriate action when an audit
storage volume is full.  If there is no evidence of appropriate action, this is
a finding.'
  desc 'fix', 'Configure RHEL 8 to shut down by default upon audit failure (unless
availability is an overriding concern).

    Add or update the following line (depending on configuration
"disk_full_action" can be set to "SYSLOG" or "SINGLE" depending on
configuration) in "/etc/audit/auditd.conf" file:

    disk_full_action = HALT

    If availability has been determined to be more important, and this decision
is documented with the ISSO, configure the operating system to notify system
administration staff and ISSO staff in the event of an audit processing failure
by setting the "disk_full_action" to "SYSLOG".'
