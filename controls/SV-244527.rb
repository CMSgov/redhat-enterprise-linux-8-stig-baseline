  desc 'The most important characteristic of a random number generator is its
randomness, namely its ability to deliver random numbers that are impossible to
predict.  Entropy in computer security is associated with the unpredictability
of a source of randomness.  The random source with high entropy tends to
achieve a uniform distribution of random values.  Random number generators are
one of the most important building blocks of cryptosystems.

    The rngd service feeds random data from hardware device to kernel random
device. Quality (non-predictable) random number generation is important for
several security functions (i.e., ciphers).'
