This option must be used for mounting any file system not containing approved
binary files, as they may be incompatible. Executing files from untrusted file
systems increases the opportunity for unprivileged users to attain unauthorized
administrative access.

untrusted file systems increases the opportunity for unprivileged users to
attain unauthorized administrative access.

any file system not containing approved "setuid" and "setguid" files.
