  desc 'Without protection of communications with wireless peripherals,
confidentiality and integrity may be compromised because unprotected
communications can be intercepted and either read, altered, or used to
compromise the RHEL 8 operating system.

    This requirement applies to wireless peripheral technologies (e.g.,
wireless mice, keyboards, displays, etc.) used with RHEL 8 systems. Wireless
peripherals (e.g., Wi-Fi/Bluetooth/IR Keyboards, Mice, and Pointing Devices and
Near Field Communications [NFC]) present a unique challenge by creating an
open, unsecured port on a computer. Wireless peripherals must meet DoD
requirements for wireless data transmission and be approved for use by the
Authorizing Official (AO). Even though some wireless peripherals, such as mice
and pointing devices, do not ordinarily carry information that need to be
protected, modification of communications with these wireless peripherals may
be used to compromise the RHEL 8 operating system. Communication paths outside
the physical protection of a controlled boundary are exposed to the possibility
of interception and modification.

    Protecting the confidentiality and integrity of communications with
wireless peripherals can be accomplished by physical means (e.g., employing
physical barriers to wireless radio frequencies) or by logical means (e.g.,
employing cryptographic techniques). If physical means of protection are
employed, then logical means (cryptography) do not have to be employed, and
vice versa. If the wireless peripheral is only passing telemetry data,
encryption of the data may not be required.'
