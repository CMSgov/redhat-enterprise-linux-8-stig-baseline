  desc 'Syscalls are special routines in the Linux kernel, which userspace
applications ask to do privileged tasks.  Invoking a system call is an
expensive operation because the processor must interrupt the currently
executing task and switch context to kernel mode and then back to userspace
after the system call completes.  Virtual Syscalls map into user space a page
that contains some variables and the implementation of some system calls.  This
allows the system calls to be executed in userspace to alleviate the context
switching expense.

    Virtual Syscalls provide an opportunity of attack for a user who has
control of the return instruction pointer.  Disabling vsyscalls help to prevent
return oriented programming (ROP) attacks via buffer overflows and overruns. If
the system intends to run containers based on RHEL 6 components, then virtual
syscalls will need enabled so the components function properly.'
