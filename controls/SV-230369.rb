  title 'RHEL 8 passwords must have a minimum of 15 characters.'
  desc 'The shorter the password, the lower the number of possible
combinations that need to be tested before the password is compromised.

    Password complexity, or strength, is a measure of the effectiveness of a
password in resisting attempts at guessing and brute-force attacks. Password
length is one factor of several that helps to determine strength and how long
it takes to crack a password. Use of more characters in a password helps to
increase exponentially the time and/or resources required to compromise the
password.

    RHEL 8 utilizes "pwquality" as a mechanism to enforce password
complexity. Configurations are set in the "etc/security/pwquality.conf" file.

    The "minlen", sometimes noted as minimum length, acts as a "score" of
complexity based on the credit components of the "pwquality" module. By
setting the credit components to a negative value, not only will those
components be required, they will not count towards the total "score" of
"minlen". This will enable "minlen" to require a 15-character minimum.

    The DoD minimum password requirement is 15 characters.'
  desc 'check', 'Verify the operating system enforces a minimum 15-character
    password length. The "minlen" option sets the minimum number of characters in a new password.

Check for the value of the "minlen" option with the following command:

$ sudo grep -r minlen /etc/security/pwquality.conf*

/etc/security/pwquality.conf:minlen = 15

If the command does not return a "minlen" value of 15 or greater, this is a finding.
If conflicting results are returned, this is a finding.'
  desc 'fix', 'Configure operating system to enforce a minimum 15-character password length.

Add the following line to "/etc/security/pwquality.conf" (or modify the line to have the required value):

minlen = 15

Remove any configurations that conflict with the above value.'
