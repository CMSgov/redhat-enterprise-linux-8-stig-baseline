  desc  "Configuring RHEL 8 to implement organization-wide security
implementation guides and security checklists ensures compliance with federal
standards and establishes a common security baseline across the DoD that
reflects the most restrictive security posture consistent with operational
requirements.

    Configuration settings are the set of parameters that can be changed in
hardware, software, or firmware components of the system that affect the
security posture and/or functionality of the system. Security-related
parameters are those parameters impacting the security state of the system,
including the parameters required to satisfy other security control
requirements. Security-related parameters include, for example: registry
settings; account, file, directory permission settings; and settings for
functions, ports, protocols, services, and remote connections.
