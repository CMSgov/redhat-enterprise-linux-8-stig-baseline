  Check the home directory assignment for all non-privileged users, users with a User Identifier (UID) greater than 1000, on the system with the following command:

     $ sudo awk -F: '($3>=1000)&&($7 !~ /nologin/){print $1,$3,$6}' /etc/passwd

     doej 1001 /home/doej
     publicj 1002 /home/publicj
     smithj 1003 /home/smithj

The output of the command will give the directory/partition that contains the home directories for the non-privileged users on the system (in this example, "/home") and users’ shell. All accounts with a valid shell (such as /bin/bash) are considered interactive users.

Check that a file system/partition has been created for the nonprivileged interactive users with the following command:

Note: The partition of "/home" is used in the example.

     $ sudo grep /home /etc/fstab

     /dev/mapper/...   /home   xfs   defaults,noexec,nosuid,nodev 0 0

If a separate entry for the file system/partition containing the nonprivileged interactive user home directories does not exist, this is a finding.)
