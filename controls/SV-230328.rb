    Verify that a separate file system/partition has been created for
non-privileged local interactive user home directories.

    Check the home directory assignment for all non-privileged users, users
with a User Identifier (UID) greater than 1000, on the system with the
following command:

    $ sudo awk -F: '($3>=1000)&&($7 !~ /nologin/){print $1,$3,$6}' /etc/passwd

    adamsj 1001 /home/adamsj
    jacksonm 1002 /home/jacksonm
    smithj 1003 /home/smithj

    The output of the command will give the directory/partition that contains
the home directories for the non-privileged users on the system (in this
example, \"/home\") and usersâ€™ shell. All accounts with a valid shell (such as
/bin/bash) are considered interactive users.

    Check that a file system/partition has been created for the non-privileged
interactive users with the following command:

    Note: The partition of \"/home\" is used in the example.

    $ sudo grep /home /etc/fstab

    UUID=333ada18 /home ext4 noatime,nobarrier,nodev 1 2

    If a separate entry for the file system/partition containing the
non-privileged interactive user home directories does not exist, this is a
finding.
