default, functionality exceeding requirements or mission objectives. These
unnecessary capabilities or services are often overlooked and therefore may
remain unsecured. They increase the risk to the platform by providing
additional attack vectors.

    Failing to disconnect unused protocols can result in a system compromise.

    The Transparent Inter-Process Communication (TIPC) protocol is designed to
provide communications between nodes in a cluster. Disabling TIPC protects the
system against exploitation of any flaws in its implementation."

If the command does not return any output, or the line is commented out, and use of the TIPC protocol is not documented with the Information System Security Officer (ISSO) as an operational requirement, this is a finding.

Verify the operating system disables the ability to use the TIPC protocol.

Check to see if the TIPC protocol is disabled with the following command:

$ sudo grep -r tipc /etc/modprobe.d/* | grep "blacklist"
