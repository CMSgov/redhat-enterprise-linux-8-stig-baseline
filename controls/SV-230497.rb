  title "RHEL 8 must disable the transparent inter-process communication (TIPC)
protocol."
  desc  "It is detrimental for operating systems to provide, or install by
default, functionality exceeding requirements or mission objectives. These
unnecessary capabilities or services are often overlooked and therefore may
remain unsecured. They increase the risk to the platform by providing
additional attack vectors.

    Failing to disconnect unused protocols can result in a system compromise.

    The Transparent Inter-Process Communication (TIPC) protocol is designed to
provide communications between nodes in a cluster. Disabling TIPC protects the
system against exploitation of any flaws in its implementation.
  "
  desc  'rationale', ''

    Verify the operating system disables the ability to load the TIPC protocol
kernel module.

    $ sudo grep -ri TIPC /etc/modprobe.d/* | grep -i \"/bin/true\"

    install TIPC /bin/true

    If the command does not return any output, or the line is commented out,
and use of the TIPC protocol is not documented with the Information System
Security Officer (ISSO) as an operational requirement, this is a finding.

    Verify the operating system disables the ability to use the TIPC protocol.

    Check to see if the TIPC protocol is disabled with the following command:

    $ sudo grep -ri TIPC /etc/modprobe.d/* | grep -i \"blacklist\"

    blacklist TIPC

    If the command does not return any output or the output is not \"blacklist
TIPC\", and use of the TIPC protocol is not documented with the Information
System Security Officer (ISSO) as an operational requirement, this is a finding.
  "
  desc 'fix', "
    Configure the operating system to disable the ability to use the TIPC
protocol kernel module.

    Add or update the following lines in the file
\"/etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\":

    install TIPC /bin/true
    blacklist TIPC

    Reboot the system for the settings to take effect.
