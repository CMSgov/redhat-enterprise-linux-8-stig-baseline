  title "The RHEL 8 file integrity tool must be configured to verify Access
Control Lists (ACLs)."
  desc  "ACLs can provide permissions beyond those permitted through the file
mode and must be verified by file integrity tools.

    RHEL 8 installation media come with a file integrity tool, Advanced
Intrusion Detection Environment (AIDE).
  "
  desc  'rationale', ''
  desc  'check', "
    Verify the file integrity tool is configured to verify ACLs.

    Note: AIDE is highly configurable at install time. This requirement assumes
the \"aide.conf\" file is under the \"/etc\" directory.

    If AIDE is not installed, ask the System Administrator how file integrity
checks are performed on the system.

    Use the following command to determine if the file is in a location other
than \"/etc/aide/aide.conf\":

    $ sudo find / -name aide.conf

    Check the \"aide.conf\" file to determine if the \"acl\" rule has been
added to the rule list being applied to the files and directories selection
lists with the following command:

    $ sudo egrep \"[+]?acl\" /etc/aide.conf

    VarFile = OwnerMode+n+l+X+acl

    If the \"acl\" rule is not being used on all selection lines in the
\"/etc/aide.conf\" file, is commented out, or ACLs are not being checked by
another file integrity tool, this is a finding.
  "
  desc 'fix', "
    Configure the file integrity tool to check file and directory ACLs.

    If AIDE is installed, ensure the \"acl\" rule is present on all file and
directory selection lists.
