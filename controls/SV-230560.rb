default, functionality exceeding requirements or mission objectives. These
unnecessary capabilities or services are often overlooked and therefore may
remain unsecured. They increase the risk to the platform by providing
additional attack vectors.

    Operating systems are capable of providing a wide variety of functions and
services. Some of the functions and services, provided by default, may not be
necessary to support essential organizational operations (e.g., key missions,
functions).

SCSI devices supported by the ipr SCSI storage device driver."
