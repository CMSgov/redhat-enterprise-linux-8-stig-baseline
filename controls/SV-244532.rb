are group-owned by a group that the user is a member.

    Check the group owner of all files and directories in a local interactive
user's home directory with the following command:

    Note: The example will be for the user "smithj", who has a home directory
of "/home/smithj".

    $ sudo ls -lLR /<home directory>/<users home directory>/
    -rw-r--r-- 1 smithj smithj  18 Mar  5 17:06 file1

    -rw-r--r-- 1 smithj sa        231 Mar  5 17:06 file3

    If any files found with a group-owner different from the home directory
user private group, check to see if the user is a member of that group with the
following command:

    $ sudo grep smithj /etc/group
    sa:x:100:juan,shelley,bob,smithj
    smithj:x:521:smithj

    If any files or directories are group owned by a group that the directory
owner is not a member of, this is a finding.)
