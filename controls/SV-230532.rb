  desc  "The debug-shell requires no authentication and provides root
privileges to anyone who has physical access to the machine.  While this
feature is disabled by default, masking it adds an additional layer of
assurance that it will not be enabled via a dependency in systemd.  This also
prevents attackers with physical access from trivially bypassing security on
the machine through valid troubleshooting configurations and gaining root
access when the system is rebooted."
