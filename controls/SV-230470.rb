  title 'RHEL 8 must enable Linux audit logging for the USBGuard daemon.'
  desc  "Without the capability to generate audit records, it would be
difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate the events relating to an
incident or identify those responsible for one.

    If auditing is enabled late in the startup process, the actions of some
startup processes may not be audited. Some audit systems also maintain state
information only available if auditing is enabled before a given process is
created.

    Audit records can be generated from various components within the
information system (e.g., module or policy filter).

    The list of audited events is the set of events for which audits are to be
generated. This set of events is typically a subset of the list of all events
for which the system is capable of generating audit records.

    DoD has defined the list of events for which RHEL 8 will provide an audit
record generation capability as the following:

    1) Successful and unsuccessful attempts to access, modify, or delete
privileges, security objects, security levels, or categories of information
(e.g., classification levels);

    2) Access actions, such as successful and unsuccessful logon attempts,
privileged activities or other system-level access, starting and ending time
for user access to the system, concurrent logons from different workstations,
successful and unsuccessful accesses to objects, all program initiations, and
all direct access to the information system;

    3) All account creations, modifications, disabling, and terminations; and

    4) All kernel module load, unload, and restart actions.

    Verify RHEL 8 enables Linux audit logging of the USBGuard daemon with the
following commands:

    Note: If the USBGuard daemon is not installed and enabled, this requirement
is not applicable.

    $ sudo grep -i auditbackend /etc/usbguard/usbguard-daemon.conf

    AuditBackend=LinuxAudit

    If the \"AuditBackend\" entry does not equal \"LinuxAudit\", is missing, or
the line is commented out, this is a finding.

  desc  'fix', "
    Configure RHEL 8 to enable Linux audit logging of the USBGuard daemon by
adding or modifying the following line in
\"/etc/usbguard/usbguard-daemon.conf\":

    AuditBackend=LinuxAudit
