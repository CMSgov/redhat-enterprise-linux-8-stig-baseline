  desc  "Terminating an idle session within a short time period reduces the
window of opportunity for unauthorized personnel to take control of a
management session enabled on the console or console port that has been left
unattended. In addition, quickly terminating an idle session will also free up
resources committed by the managed network element.

    Terminating network connections associated with communications sessions
includes, for example, de-allocating associated TCP/IP address/port pairs at
the operating system level and de-allocating networking assignments at the
application level if multiple application sessions are using a single operating
system-level network connection. This does not mean the operating system
terminates all sessions or network access; it only ends the inactive session
and releases the resources associated with that session.

    Verify the operating system initiates a session lock after #{input('system_inactivity_timeout_minutes')} minutes of
inactivity.

    Check the value of the system inactivity timeout with the following command:

    $ sudo grep -i lock-after-time /etc/tmux.conf

    set -g lock-after-time #{input('system_inactivity_timeout')}

    If \"lock-after-time\" is not set to \"#{input('system_inactivity_timeout')}\" or less in the global tmux
configuration file to enforce session lock after inactivity, this is a finding.
  "
  desc 'fix', "
    Configure the operating system to enforce session lock after a period of #{input('system_inactivity_timeout_minutes')}
minutes of inactivity by adding the following line to the \"/etc/tmux.conf\"
global configuration file:

    set -g lock-after-time #{input('system_inactivity_timeout')}
