  title "RHEL 8 must implement NIST FIPS-validated cryptography for the
following: to provision digital signatures, to generate cryptographic hashes,
and to protect data requiring data-at-rest protections in accordance with
applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations,
and standards."
  desc  "Use of weak or untested encryption algorithms undermines the purposes
of using encryption to protect data. The operating system must implement
cryptographic modules adhering to the higher standards approved by the Federal
Government since this provides assurance they have been tested and validated.

    RHEL 8 utilizes GRUB 2 as the default bootloader. Note that GRUB 2
command-line parameters are defined in the \"kernelopts\" variable of the
/boot/grub2/grubenv file for all kernel boot entries.  The command
\"fips-mode-setup\" modifies the \"kernelopts\" variable, which in turn updates
all kernel boot entries.

    The fips=1 kernel option needs to be added to the kernel command line
during system installation so that key generation is done with FIPS-approved
algorithms and continuous monitoring tests in place. Users must also ensure the
system has plenty of entropy during the installation process by moving the
mouse around, or if no mouse is available, ensuring that many keystrokes are
typed. The recommended amount of keystrokes is 256 and more. Less than 256
keystrokes may generate a non-unique key.

    Verify the operating system implements DoD-approved encryption to protect
the confidentiality of remote access sessions.

    Check to see if FIPS mode is enabled with the following command:

    $ sudo fipscheck

    usage: fipscheck [-s <hmac-suffix>] <paths-to-files>

    fips mode is on

    If FIPS mode is \"on\", check to see if the kernel boot parameter is
configured for FIPS mode with the following command:

    $ sudo grub2-editenv - list | grep fips

    kernelopts=root=/dev/mapper/rhel-root ro crashkernel=auto
resume=/dev/mapper/rhel-swap rd.lvm.lv=rhel/root rd.lvm.lv=rhel/swap rhgb quiet
fips=1 boot=UUID=8d171156-cd61-421c-ba41-1c021ac29e82

    If the kernel boot parameter is configured to use FIPS mode, check to see
if the system is in FIPS mode with the following command:

    $ sudo cat /proc/sys/crypto/fips_enabled

    1

    If FIPS mode is not \"on\", the kernel boot parameter is not configured for
FIPS mode, or the system does not have a value of \"1\" for \"fips_enabled\" in
\"/proc/sys/crypto\", this is a finding.

    Configure the operating system to implement DoD-approved encryption by
following the steps below:

    To enable strict FIPS compliance, the fips=1 kernel option needs to be
added to the kernel boot parameters during system installation so key
generation is done with FIPS-approved algorithms and continuous monitoring
tests in place.

    Enable FIPS mode after installation (not strict FIPS compliant) with the
following command:

    $ sudo fips-mode-setup --enable

    Reboot the system for the changes to take effect.
