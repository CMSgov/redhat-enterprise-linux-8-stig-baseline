  title "The RHEL 8 file integrity tool must be configured to verify extended
attributes."
  desc  "Extended attributes in file systems are used to contain arbitrary data
and file metadata with security implications.

    RHEL 8 installation media come with a file integrity tool, Advanced
Intrusion Detection Environment (AIDE).
  "
  desc  'rationale', ''
  desc  'check', "
    Verify the file integrity tool is configured to verify extended attributes.

    If AIDE is not installed, ask the System Administrator how file integrity
checks are performed on the system.

    Note: AIDE is highly configurable at install time. This requirement assumes
the \"aide.conf\" file is under the \"/etc\" directory.

    Use the following command to determine if the file is in another location:

    $ sudo find / -name aide.conf

    Check the \"aide.conf\" file to determine if the \"xattrs\" rule has been
added to the rule list being applied to the files and directories selection
lists.

    An example rule that includes the \"xattrs\" rule follows:

    All= p+i+n+u+g+s+m+S+sha512+acl+xattrs+selinux
    /bin All # apply the custom rule to the files in bin
    /sbin All # apply the same custom rule to the files in sbin

    If the \"xattrs\" rule is not being used on all uncommented selection lines
in the \"/etc/aide.conf\" file, or extended attributes are not being checked by
another file integrity tool, this is a finding.
  "
  desc 'fix', "
    Configure the file integrity tool to check file and directory extended
attributes.

    If AIDE is installed, ensure the \"xattrs\" rule is present on all
uncommented file and directory selection lists.
