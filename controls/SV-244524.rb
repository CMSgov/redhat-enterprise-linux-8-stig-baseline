cryptographic module are not verified and therefore cannot be relied upon to

    RHEL 8 systems utilizing encryption are required to use FIPS-compliant
mechanisms for authenticating to cryptographic modules.

    FIPS 140-2 is the current standard for validating that mechanisms used to
access cryptographic modules utilize authentication that meets DoD
requirements. This allows for Security Levels 1, 2, 3, or 4 for use on a

    Verify that pam_unix.so module is configured to use sha512.

    Check that pam_unix.so module is configured to use sha512 in
/etc/pam.d/system-auth with the following command:

    $ sudo grep password /etc/pam.d/system-auth | grep pam_unix

    password sufficient pam_unix.so sha512 rounds=5000

    If \"sha512\" is missing, or is commented out, this is a finding.
