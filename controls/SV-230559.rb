default, functionality exceeding requirements or mission objectives. These
unnecessary capabilities or services are often overlooked and therefore may
remain unsecured. They increase the risk to the platform by providing
additional attack vectors.

    Operating systems are capable of providing a wide variety of functions and
services. Some of the functions and services, provided by default, may not be
necessary to support essential organizational operations (e.g., key missions,
functions).

    The gssproxy package is a proxy for GSS API credential handling and could
expose secrets on some networks. It is not needed for normal function of the OS.

    Verify the gssproxy package has not been installed on the system with the
following commands:

    $ sudo yum list installed gssproxy

Information System Security Officer (ISSO) as an operational requirement, this
is a finding.
