  desc '"Firewalld" provides an easy and effective way to block/limit remote
access to the system via ports, services, and protocols.

    Remote access services, such as those providing remote access to network
devices and information systems, which lack automated control capabilities,
increase risk and make remote user access management difficult at best.

    Remote access is access to DoD nonpublic information systems by an
authorized user (or an information system) communicating through an external,
non-organization-controlled network. Remote access methods include, for
example, dial-up, broadband, and wireless.
    RHEL 8 functionality (e.g., RDP) must be capable of taking enforcement
action if the audit reveals unauthorized activity. Automated control of remote
access sessions allows organizations to ensure ongoing compliance with remote
access policies by enforcing connection rules of remote access applications on
a variety of information system components (e.g., servers, workstations,
notebook computers, smartphones, and tablets).'
