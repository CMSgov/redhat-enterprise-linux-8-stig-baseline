  title "Successful/unsuccessful uses of the umount command in RHEL 8 must
generate an audit record."
  desc  "Without generating audit records that are specific to the security and
mission needs of the organization, it would be difficult to establish,
correlate, and investigate the events relating to an incident or identify those
responsible for one.

    Audit records can be generated from various components within the
information system (e.g., module or policy filter). The \"umount\" command is
used to unmount a filesystem.

    When a user logs on, the AUID is set to the UID of the account that is
being authenticated. Daemons are not user sessions and have the loginuid set to
\"-1\". The AUID representation is an unsigned 32-bit integer, which equals
\"4294967295\". The audit system interprets \"-1\", \"4294967295\", and
\"unset\" in the same way.


  "
  desc  'rationale', ''
  desc  'check', "
    Verify that an audit event is generated for any successful/unsuccessful use
of the \"umount\" command by performing the following command to check the file
system rules in \"/etc/audit/audit.rules\":

    $ sudo grep -w /usr/bin/umount /etc/audit/audit.rules

    -a always,exit -F path=/usr/bin/umount -F perm=x -F auid>=1000 -F
auid!=unset -k privileged-mount

    If the command does not return a line, or the line is commented out, this
is a finding.
  "
  desc 'fix', "
    Configure the audit system to generate an audit event for any
successful/unsuccessful use of the \"umount\" command by adding or updating the
following rules in the \"/etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules\" file:

    -a always,exit -F path=/usr/bin/umount -F perm=x -F auid>=1000 -F
auid!=unset -k privileged-mount

    The audit daemon must be restarted for the changes to take effect.
