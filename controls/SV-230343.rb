occur."
  desc  "By limiting the number of failed logon attempts, the risk of
unauthorized system access via user password guessing, otherwise known as
brute-force attacks, is reduced. Limits are imposed by locking the account.

    In RHEL 8.2 the \"/etc/security/faillock.conf\" file was incorporated to
centralize the configuration of the pam_faillock.so module.  Also introduced is
a \"local_users_only\" option that will only track failed user authentication
attempts for local users in /etc/passwd and ignore centralized (AD, IdM, LDAP,
etc.) users to allow the centralized platform to solely manage user lockout.

    From \"faillock.conf\" man pages: Note that the default directory that
\"pam_faillock\" uses is usually cleared on system boot so the access will be
reenabled after system reboot. If that is undesirable a different tally
directory must be set with the \"dir\" option.

    Verify the \"/etc/security/faillock.conf\" file is configured to log user
name information when unsuccessful logon attempts occur:

    audit
