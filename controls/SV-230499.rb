  desc  "It is detrimental for operating systems to provide, or install by
default, functionality exceeding requirements or mission objectives. These
unnecessary capabilities or services are often overlooked and therefore may
remain unsecured. They increase the risk to the platform by providing
additional attack vectors.

    The IEEE 1394 (FireWire) is a serial bus standard for high-speed real-time
communication. Disabling FireWire protects the system against exploitation of
any flaws in its implementation.

    Verify the operating system disables the ability to load the firewire-core
kernel module.

    $ sudo grep -ri firewire-core /etc/modprobe.d/* | grep -i \"/bin/true\"

    install firewire-core /bin/true

    If the command does not return any output, or the line is commented out,
and use of the firewire-core protocol is not documented with the Information
System Security Officer (ISSO) as an operational requirement, this is a finding.

    Verify the operating system disables the ability to use the firewire-core
kernel module.

    Check to see if the firewire-core kernel module is disabled with the
following command:

    $ sudo grep -ri firewire-core /etc/modprobe.d/* | grep -i \"blacklist\"

    blacklist firewire-core

    If the command does not return any output or the output is not \"blacklist
firewire-core\", and use of the firewire-core kernel module is not documented
with the Information System Security Officer (ISSO) as an operational
requirement, this is a finding.

  desc 'fix', "
    Configure the operating system to disable the ability to use the
firewire-core kernel module.

    Add or update the following lines in the file
\"/etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\":

    install firewire-core /bin/true
    blacklist firewire-core

    Reboot the system for the settings to take effect.
