disabled."
  desc  "A locally logged-on user who presses Ctrl-Alt-Delete when at the
console can reboot the system. If accidentally pressed, as could happen in the
case of a mixed OS environment, this can create the risk of short-term loss of
availability of systems due to unintentional reboot. In a graphical user
environment, risk of unintentional reboot from the Ctrl-Alt-Delete sequence is
reduced because the user will be prompted before any action is taken."

    Verify RHEL 8 is not configured to reboot the system when Ctrl-Alt-Delete
is pressed seven times within two seconds with the following command:

    $ sudo grep -i ctrl /etc/systemd/system.conf

    CtrlAltDelBurstAction=none

    If the \"CtrlAltDelBurstAction\" is not set to \"none\", commented out, or
is missing, this is a finding.
  "
  desc 'fix', "
    Configure the system to disable the CtrlAltDelBurstAction by added or
modifying the following line in the \"/etc/systemd/system.conf\" configuration
file:

    CtrlAltDelBurstAction=none

    Reload the daemon for this change to take effect.

    $ sudo systemctl daemon-reload
