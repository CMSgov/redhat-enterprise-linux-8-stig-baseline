    Verify RHEL 8 displays a banner before granting access to the operating
system via a graphical user logon.

    Note: This requirement assumes the use of the RHEL 8 default graphical user
interface, Gnome Shell. If the system does not have any graphical user
interface installed, this requirement is Not Applicable.

    Check to see if the operating system displays a banner at the logon screen
with the following command:

    $ sudo grep banner-message-enable /etc/dconf/db/local.d/*

    banner-message-enable=true

    If \"banner-message-enable\" is set to \"false\" or is missing, this is a
finding.
  "
  desc  'fix', "
    Configure the operating system to display a banner before granting access
to the system.

    Note: If the system does not have a graphical user interface installed,
this requirement is Not Applicable.

    Create a database to contain the system-wide graphical user logon settings
(if it does not already exist) with the following command:

    $ sudo touch /etc/dconf/db/local.d/01-banner-message

    Add the following lines to the [org/gnome/login-screen] section of the
\"/etc/dconf/db/local.d/01-banner-message\":

    [org/gnome/login-screen]

    banner-message-enable=true

    Run the following command to update the database:

    $ sudo dconf update
