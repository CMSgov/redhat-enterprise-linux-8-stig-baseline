  desc  "Inaccurate time stamps make it more difficult to correlate events and
can lead to an inaccurate analysis. Determining the correct time a particular
event occurred on a system is critical when conducting forensic analysis and
investigating system events. Sources outside the configured acceptable
allowance (drift) may be inaccurate.

    Minimizing the exposure of the server functionality of the chrony daemon
diminishes the attack surface.

    RHEL 8 utilizes the \"timedatectl\" command to view the status of the
\"systemd-timesyncd.service\". The \"timedatectl\" status will display the
local time, UTC, and the offset from UTC.

    Verify RHEL 8 disables the chrony daemon from acting as a server with the
following command:

    $ sudo grep -w 'port' /etc/chrony.conf

    port 0

    If the \"port\" option is not set to \"0\", is commented out or missing,
this is a finding.

    Configure the operating system to disable the chrony daemon from acting as
a server by adding/modifying the following line in the /etc/chrony.conf file.

    port 0
