  title "RHEL 8 must require the change of at least #{input('difok')} characters when passwords

  desc  "Use of a complex password helps to increase the time and resources
required to compromise the password. Password complexity, or strength, is a
measure of the effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts at guessing
and brute-force attacks.

    Password complexity is one factor of several that determines how long it
takes to crack a password. The more complex the password, the greater the
number of possible combinations that need to be tested before the password is
compromised.

    RHEL 8 utilizes \"pwquality\" as a mechanism to enforce password
complexity. The \"difok\" option sets the number of characters in a password
that must not be present in the old password.

    Verify the value of the \"difok\" option in
\"/etc/security/pwquality.conf\" with the following command:

    $ sudo grep difok /etc/security/pwquality.conf

    difok = #{input('difok')}

    If the value of \"difok\" is set to less than \"#{input('difok')}\" or is commented out,
this is a finding.
  "
  desc 'fix', "
    Configure the operating system to require the change of at least #{input('difok')} of
the total number of characters when passwords are changed by setting the
\"difok\" option.

    Add the following line to \"/etc/security/pwquality.conf\" (or modify the
line to have the required value):

    difok = #{input('difok')}
