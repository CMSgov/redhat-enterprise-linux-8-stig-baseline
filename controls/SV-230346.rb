  desc 'Operating system management includes the ability to control the number
of users and user sessions that utilize an operating system. Limiting the
number of allowed users and sessions per user is helpful in reducing the risks
related to DoS attacks.

    This requirement addresses concurrent sessions for information system
accounts and does not address concurrent sessions by single users via multiple
system accounts. The maximum number of concurrent sessions should be defined
based on mission needs and the operational environment for each system.'

    $ sudo grep -r -s '^[^#].*maxlogins' /etc/security/limits.conf
/etc/security/limits.d/*.conf

    * hard maxlogins 10

    This can be set as a global domain (with the * wildcard) but may be set
differently for multiple domains.

greater than "10" and is not documented with the Information System Security
Officer (ISSO) as an operational requirement for all domains that have the
"maxlogins" item assigned, this is a finding.)
