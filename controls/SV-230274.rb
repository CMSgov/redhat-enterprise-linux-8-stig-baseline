  title "RHEL 8 must implement certificate status checking for multifactor
authentication."
  desc  "Using an authentication device, such as a DoD Common Access Card (CAC)
or token that is separate from the information system, ensures that even if the
information system is compromised, credentials stored on the authentication
device will not be affected.

    Multifactor solutions that require devices separate from information
systems gaining access include, for example, hardware tokens providing
time-based or challenge-response authenticators and smart cards such as the
U.S. Government Personal Identity Verification (PIV) card and the DoD CAC.

    RHEL 8 includes multiple options for configuring certificate status
checking, but for this requirement focuses on the System Security Services
Daemon (SSSD). By default, sssd performs Online Certificate Status Protocol
(OCSP) checking and certificate verification using a sha256 digest function.


  "
  desc  'rationale', ''
  desc  'check', "
    Verify the operating system implements certificate status checking for
multifactor authentication.

    Check to see if Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) is enabled and
using the proper digest value on the system with the following command:

    $ sudo grep certificate_verification /etc/sssd/sssd.conf
/etc/sssd/conf.d/*.conf | grep -v \"^#\"

    certificate_verification = ocsp_dgst=sha1

    If the certificate_verification line is missing from the [sssd] section, or
is missing \"ocsp_dgst=sha1\", ask the administrator to indicate what type of
multifactor authentication is being utilized and how the system implements
certificate status checking.  If there is no evidence of certificate status
checking being used, this is a finding.
  "
  desc 'fix', "
    Configure the operating system to implement certificate status checking for
multifactor authentication.

    Review the \"/etc/sssd/sssd.conf\" file to determine if the system is
configured to prevent OCSP or certificate verification.

    Add the following line to the \"/etc/sssd/sssd.conf\" file:

    certificate_verification = ocsp_dgst=sha1

    The \"sssd\" service must be restarted for the changes to take effect. To
restart the \"sssd\" service, run the following command:

    $ sudo systemctl restart sssd.service
