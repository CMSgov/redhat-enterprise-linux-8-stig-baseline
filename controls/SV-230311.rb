    Verify RHEL 8 disables storing core dumps with the following commands:

    $ sudo sysctl kernel.core_pattern

    kernel.core_pattern = |/bin/false

    If the returned line does not have a value of \"|/bin/false\", or a line is
not returned and the need for core dumps is not documented with the Information
System Security Officer (ISSO) as an operational requirement, this is a finding.

  desc 'fix', "
    Configure RHEL 8 to disable storing core dumps by adding the following line
to a file in the \"/etc/sysctl.d\" directory:

    kernel.core_pattern = |/bin/false

    The system configuration files need to be reloaded for the changes to take
effect. To reload the contents of the files, run the following command:

    $ sudo sysctl --system
