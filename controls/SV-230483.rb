    Configure the operating system to initiate an action to notify the SA and
ISSO (at a minimum) when allocated audit record storage volume reaches #{input('storage_volume')}
percent of the repository maximum audit record storage capacity by
adding/modifying the following line in the /etc/audit/auditd.conf file.
