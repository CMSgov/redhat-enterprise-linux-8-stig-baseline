  desc  "Without path validation, an informed trust decision by the relying
party cannot be made when presented with any certificate not already explicitly
trusted.

    A trust anchor is an authoritative entity represented via a public key and
associated data. It is used in the context of public key infrastructures, X.509
digital certificates, and DNSSEC.

    When there is a chain of trust, usually the top entity to be trusted
becomes the trust anchor; it can be, for example, a Certification Authority
(CA). A certification path starts with the subject certificate and proceeds
through a number of intermediate certificates up to a trusted root certificate,
typically issued by a trusted CA.

    This requirement verifies that a certification path to an accepted trust
anchor is used for certificate validation and that the path includes status
information. Path validation is necessary for a relying party to make an
informed trust decision when presented with any certificate not already
explicitly trusted. Status information for certification paths includes
certificate revocation lists or online certificate status protocol responses.
Validation of the certificate status information is out of scope for this
requirement.

    Verify RHEL 8 for PKI-based authentication has valid certificates by
constructing a certification path (which includes status information) to an
accepted trust anchor.

    Check that the system has a valid DoD root CA installed with the following
command:

    $ sudo openssl x509 -text -in /etc/sssd/pki/sssd_auth_ca_db.pem

    Certificate:
       Data:
          Version: 3 (0x2)
          Serial Number: 1 (0x1)
          Signature Algorithm: sha256WithRSAEncryption
          Issuer: C = US, O = U.S. Government, OU = DoD, OU = PKI, CN = DoD
Root CA 3
          Validity
             Not Before: Mar 20 18:46:41 2012 GMT
             Not After   : Dec 30 18:46:41 2029 GMT
          Subject: C = US, O = U.S. Government, OU = DoD, OU = PKI, CN = DoD
Root CA 3
          Subject Public Key Info:
             Public Key Algorithm: rsaEncryption

    If the root ca file is not a DoD-issued certificate with a valid date and
installed in the /etc/sssd/pki/sssd_auth_ca_db.pem location, this is a finding.

    Configure RHEL 8, for PKI-based authentication, to validate certificates by
constructing a certification path (which includes status information) to an
accepted trust anchor.

    Obtain a valid copy of the DoD root CA file from the PKI CA certificate
bundle from cyber.mil and copy the DoD_PKE_CA_chain.pem into the following file:

    /etc/sssd/pki/sssd_auth_ca_db.pem
