released by an administrator when #{input('unsuccessful_atempts')} unsuccessful logon attempts occur
during a #{input('fail_interval_time')[:minutes]}-minute time period."
  desc  "By limiting the number of failed logon attempts, the risk of
unauthorized system access via user password guessing, otherwise known as
brute-force attacks, is reduced. Limits are imposed by locking the account.

    RHEL 8 can utilize the \"pam_faillock.so\" for this purpose. Note that
manual changes to the listed files may be overwritten by the \"authselect\"
program.

    From \"Pam_Faillock\" man pages: Note that the default directory that
\"pam_faillock\" uses is usually cleared on system boot so the access will be
reenabled after system reboot. If that is undesirable a different tally
directory must be set with the \"dir\" option.

    Check that the system locks an account after #{input('unsuccessful_atempts')} unsuccessful logon
attempts within a period of #{input('fail_interval_time')[:minutes]} minutes until released by an administrator with
the following commands:

    Note: If the System Administrator demonstrates the use of an approved
centralized account management method that locks an account after #{input('unsuccessful_atempts')}
unsuccessful logon attempts within a period of #{input('fail_interval_time')[:minutes]} minutes, this requirement is
not applicable.

    Note: This check applies to RHEL versions 8.0 and 8.1, if the system is
RHEL version 8.2 or newer, this check is not applicable.

    Configure the operating system to lock an account until released by an
administrator when #{input('unsuccessful_atempts')} unsuccessful logon attempts occur in #{input('fail_interval')[:minutes]} minutes.

    Add/Modify the appropriate sections of the \"/etc/pam.d/system-auth\" and
\"/etc/pam.d/password-auth\" files to match the following lines:

    auth required pam_faillock.so preauth dir=/var/log/faillock silent audit
