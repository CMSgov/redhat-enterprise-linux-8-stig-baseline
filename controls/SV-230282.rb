not operate correctly and the failure may go unnoticed. Security function is
defined as the hardware, software, and/or firmware of the information system
responsible for enforcing the system security policy and supporting the
isolation of code and data on which the protection is based. Security
functionality includes, but is not limited to, establishing system accounts,
configuring access authorizations (i.e., permissions, privileges), setting
events to be audited, and setting intrusion detection parameters.
