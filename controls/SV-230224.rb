information that requires at rest protection.'
  desc 'RHEL 8 systems handling data requiring "data at rest" protections
must employ cryptographic mechanisms to prevent unauthorized disclosure and
modification of the information at rest.

    Selection of a cryptographic mechanism is based on the need to protect the
integrity of organizational information. The strength of the mechanism is
commensurate with the security category and/or classification of the
information. Organizations have the flexibility to either encrypt all
information on storage devices (i.e., full disk encryption) or encrypt specific
data structures (e.g., files, records, or fields).'
  desc 'check', 'Verify RHEL 8 prevents unauthorized disclosure or modification of all
information requiring at-rest protection by using disk encryption.

    If there is a documented and approved reason for not having data-at-rest
encryption, this requirement is Not Applicable.

    Verify all system partitions are encrypted with the following command:

    $ sudo blkid

    /dev/mapper/rhel-root:  UUID="67b7d7fe-de60-6fd0-befb-e6748cf97743"
TYPE="crypto_LUKS"

    Every persistent disk partition present must be of type "crypto_LUKS". If
any partitions other than pseudo file systems (such as /proc or /sys) are not
type "crypto_LUKS", ask the administrator to indicate how the partitions are
encrypted.  If there is no evidence that all local disk partitions are
encrypted, this is a finding.'
  desc 'fix', 'Configure RHEL 8 to prevent unauthorized modification of all information at
rest by using disk encryption.

    Encrypting a partition in an already installed system is more difficult,
because existing partitions will need to be resized and changed. To encrypt an
entire partition, dedicate a partition for encryption in the partition layout.'
