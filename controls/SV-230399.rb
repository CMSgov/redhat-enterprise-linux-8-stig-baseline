    Verify the audit log directory is owned by \"root\" to prevent unauthorized
read access.

    Determine where the audit logs are stored with the following command:

    $ sudo grep -iw log_file /etc/audit/auditd.conf

    log_file = /var/log/audit/audit.log

    Determine the owner of the audit log directory by using the output of the
above command (ex: \"/var/log/audit/\"). Run the following command with the
correct audit log directory path:

    $ sudo ls -ld /var/log/audit

    drw------- 2 root root 23 Jun 11 11:56 /var/log/audit

    If the audit log directory is not owned by \"root\", this is a finding.
  "
  desc 'fix', "
    Configure the audit log to be protected from unauthorized read access, by
setting the correct owner as \"root\" with the following command:

    $ sudo chown root [audit_log_directory]

    Replace \"[audit_log_directory]\" with the correct audit log directory
path, by default this location is usually \"/var/log/audit\".
