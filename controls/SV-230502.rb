    Verify the operating system disables the ability to automount devices.

    Check to see if automounter service is active with the following command:

    Note: If the autofs service is not installed, this requirement is not
applicable.

    $ sudo systemctl status autofs

    autofs.service - Automounts filesystems on demand
    Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/autofs.service; disabled)
    Active: inactive (dead)

    If the \"autofs\" status is set to \"active\" and is not documented with
the Information System Security Officer (ISSO) as an operational requirement,
this is a finding.
  "
  desc 'fix', "
    Configure the operating system to disable the ability to automount devices.

    Turn off the automount service with the following commands:

    $ sudo systemctl stop autofs
    $ sudo systemctl disable autofs

    If \"autofs\" is required for Network File System (NFS), it must be
documented with the ISSO.
