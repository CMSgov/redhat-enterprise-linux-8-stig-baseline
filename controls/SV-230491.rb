vulnerabilities.'
  desc 'It is detrimental for operating systems to provide, or install by
default, functionality exceeding requirements or mission objectives. These
unnecessary capabilities or services are often overlooked and therefore may
remain unsecured. They increase the risk to the platform by providing
additional attack vectors.

    Operating systems are capable of providing a wide variety of functions and
services. Some of the functions and services, provided by default, may not be
necessary to support essential organizational operations (e.g., key missions,
functions).

    Examples of non-essential capabilities include, but are not limited to,
games, software packages, tools, and demonstration software not related to
requirements or providing a wide array of functionality not required for every
mission, but which cannot be disabled.

    Verify the operating system is configured to disable non-essential
capabilities. The most secure way of ensuring a non-essential capability is
disabled is to not have the capability installed.

    Kernel page-table isolation is a kernel feature that mitigates the Meltdown
security vulnerability and hardens the kernel against attempts to bypass kernel
address space layout randomization (KASLR).'

$ sudo grub2-editenv list | grep pti

Check that kernel page-table isolation is enabled by default to persist in kernel updates:
