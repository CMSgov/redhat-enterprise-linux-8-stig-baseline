  title "RHEL 8 must block unauthorized peripherals before establishing a
connection."
  desc  "Without authenticating devices, unidentified or unknown devices may be
introduced, thereby facilitating malicious activity.

    Peripherals include, but are not limited to, such devices as flash drives,
external storage, and printers.

    A new feature that RHEL 8 provides is the USBGuard software framework. The
USBguard-daemon is the main component of the USBGuard software framework. It
runs as a service in the background and enforces the USB device authorization
policy for all USB devices. The policy is defined by a set of rules using a
rule language described in the usbguard-rules.conf file. The policy and the
authorization state of USB devices can be modified during runtime using the
usbguard tool.

    The System Administrator (SA) must work with the site Information System
Security Officer (ISSO) to determine a list of authorized peripherals and
establish rules within the USBGuard software framework to allow only authorized
devices.
  "
  desc  'rationale', ''
  desc  'check', "
    Verify the USBGuard has a policy configured with the following command:

    $ sudo usbguard list-rules

    If the command does not return results or an error is returned, ask the SA
to indicate how unauthorized peripherals are being blocked.

    If there is no evidence that unauthorized peripherals are being blocked
before establishing a connection, this is a finding.
  "
  desc  'fix', "
    Configure the operating system to enable the blocking of unauthorized
peripherals with the following command:
    This command must be run from a root shell and will create an allow list
for any usb devices currently connect to the system.

    # usbguard generate-policy > /etc/usbguard/rules.conf

    Note: Enabling and starting usbguard without properly configuring it for an
individual system will immediately prevent any access over a usb device such as
a keyboard or mouse
