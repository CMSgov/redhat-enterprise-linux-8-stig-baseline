unnecessary capabilities or services are often overlooked and therefore may

    Verify RHEL 8 restricts exposed kernel pointer addresses access with the
following commands:

    $ sudo sysctl kernel.kptr_restrict

    kernel.kptr_restrict = 1

    If the returned line does not have a value of \"1\", or a line is not
returned, this is a finding.

    Configure RHEL 8 to restrict exposed kernel pointer addresses access by
adding the following line to a file in the \"/etc/sysctl.d\" directory:

    kernel.kptr_restrict = 1

    The system configuration files need to be reloaded for the changes to take
effect. To reload the contents of the files, run the following command:

    $ sudo sysctl --system
