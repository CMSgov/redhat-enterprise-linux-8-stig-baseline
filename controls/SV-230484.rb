  title 'RHEL 8 must securely compare internal information system clocks at
least every 24 hours with a server synchronized to an authoritative time
source, such as the United States Naval Observatory (USNO) time servers, or a
time server designated for the appropriate DoD network (NIPRNet/SIPRNet),
and/or the Global Positioning System (GPS).'
  desc 'Inaccurate time stamps make it more difficult to correlate events and
can lead to an inaccurate analysis. Determining the correct time a particular
event occurred on a system is critical when conducting forensic analysis and
investigating system events. Sources outside the configured acceptable
allowance (drift) may be inaccurate.

    Synchronizing internal information system clocks provides uniformity of
time stamps for information systems with multiple system clocks and systems
connected over a network.

    Organizations should consider endpoints that may not have regular access to
the authoritative time server (e.g., mobile, teleworking, and tactical
endpoints).

    If time stamps are not consistently applied and there is no common time
reference, it is difficult to perform forensic analysis.

    Time stamps generated by the operating system include date and time. Time
is commonly expressed in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), a modern
continuation of Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), or local time with an offset from
UTC.

    RHEL 8 utilizes the "timedatectl" command to view the status of the
"systemd-timesyncd.service". The "timedatectl" status will display the
local time, UTC, and the offset from UTC.

    Note that USNO offers authenticated NTP service to DoD and U.S. Government
agencies operating on the NIPR and SIPR networks. Visit
https://www.usno.navy.mil/USNO/time/ntp/dod-customers for more information.'
