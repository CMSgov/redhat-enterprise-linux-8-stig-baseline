the server and client displays if the sshd proxy display is configured to
listen on the wildcard address.  By default, sshd binds the forwarding server
to the loopback address and sets the hostname part of the DIPSLAY environment

    Verify the SSH daemon prevents remote hosts from connecting to the proxy
display.

    Check the SSH X11UseLocalhost setting with the following command:

    # sudo grep -i x11uselocalhost /etc/ssh/sshd_config
    X11UseLocalhost yes

    If the \"X11UseLocalhost\" keyword is set to \"no\", is missing, or is
commented out, this is a finding.

    Configure the SSH daemon to prevent remote hosts from connecting to the
proxy display.

    Edit the \"/etc/ssh/sshd_config\" file to uncomment or add the line for the
\"X11UseLocalhost\" keyword and set its value to \"yes\" (this file may be
named differently or be in a different location if using a version of SSH that
is provided by a third-party vendor):

    X11UseLocalhost yes
