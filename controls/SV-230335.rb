brute-force attacks, is reduced. Limits are imposed by locking the account.

    In RHEL 8.2 the "/etc/security/faillock.conf" file was incorporated to
centralize the configuration of the pam_faillock.so module.  Also introduced is
a "local_users_only" option that will only track failed user authentication
attempts for local users in /etc/passwd and ignore centralized (AD, IdM, LDAP,
etc.) users to allow the centralized platform to solely manage user lockout.

    From "faillock.conf" man pages: Note that the default directory that
"pam_faillock" uses is usually cleared on system boot so the access will be
reenabled after system reboot. If that is undesirable a different tally
directory must be set with the "dir" option.'
