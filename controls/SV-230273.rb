or token that is separate from the information system, ensures that even if the
information system is compromised, credentials stored on the authentication
device will not be affected.

    Multifactor solutions that require devices separate from information
systems gaining access include, for example, hardware tokens providing
time-based or challenge-response authenticators and smart cards such as the
U.S. Government Personal Identity Verification (PIV) card and the DoD CAC.

    A privileged account is defined as an information system account with
authorizations of a privileged user.

    Remote access is access to DoD nonpublic information systems by an
authorized user (or an information system) communicating through an external,
non-organization-controlled network. Remote access methods include, for
example, dial-up, broadband, and wireless.

    This requirement only applies to components where this is specific to the
function of the device or has the concept of an organizational user (e.g., VPN,
proxy capability). This does not apply to authentication for the purpose of
configuring the device itself (management).'
