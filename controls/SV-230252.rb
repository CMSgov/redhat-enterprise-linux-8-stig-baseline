  title "The RHEL 8 operating system must implement DoD-approved encryption to
protect the confidentiality of SSH server connections."
  desc  "Without cryptographic integrity protections, information can be
altered by unauthorized users without detection.

    Remote access (e.g., RDP) is access to DoD nonpublic information systems by
an authorized user (or an information system) communicating through an
external, non-organization-controlled network. Remote access methods include,
for example, dial-up, broadband, and wireless.

    Cryptographic mechanisms used for protecting the integrity of information
include, for example, signed hash functions using asymmetric cryptography
enabling distribution of the public key to verify the hash information while
maintaining the confidentiality of the secret key used to generate the hash.

    RHEL 8 incorporates system-wide crypto policies by default. The SSH
configuration file has no effect on the ciphers, MACs, or algorithms unless
specifically defined in the /etc/sysconfig/sshd file. The employed algorithms
can be viewed in the /etc/crypto-policies/back-ends/opensshserver.config file.

    The system will attempt to use the first hash presented by the client that
matches the server list. Listing the values \"strongest to weakest\" is a
method to ensure the use of the strongest hash available to secure the SSH
connection.

    Verify the SSH server is configured to use only ciphers employing FIPS
140-2-approved algorithms with the following command:

    $ sudo grep -i ciphers /etc/crypto-policies/back-ends/opensshserver.config

    CRYPTO_POLICY='-oCiphers=aes256-ctr,aes192-ctr,aes128-ctr'

    If the cipher entries in the \"opensshserver.config\" file have any ciphers
other than \"aes256-ctr,aes192-ctr,aes128-ctr\", the order differs from the
example above, they are missing, or commented out, this is a finding.

    Configure the RHEL 8 SSH server to use only ciphers employing FIPS
140-2-approved algorithms by updating the
\"/etc/crypto-policies/back-ends/opensshserver.config\" file with the following
line:

    -oCiphers=aes256-ctr,aes192-ctr,aes128-ctr

    A reboot is required for the changes to take effect.
