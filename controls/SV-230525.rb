  title "A firewall must be able to protect against or limit the effects of
Denial of Service (DoS) attacks by ensuring RHEL 8 can implement rate-limiting
measures on impacted network interfaces."
  desc  "DoS is a condition when a resource is not available for legitimate
users. When this occurs, the organization either cannot accomplish its mission
or must operate at degraded capacity.

    This requirement addresses the configuration of RHEL 8 to mitigate the
impact of DoS attacks that have occurred or are ongoing on system availability.
For each system, known and potential DoS attacks must be identified and
solutions for each type implemented. A variety of technologies exists to limit
or, in some cases, eliminate the effects of DoS attacks (e.g., limiting
processes or establishing memory partitions). Employing increased capacity and
bandwidth, combined with service redundancy, may reduce the susceptibility to
some DoS attacks.

    Since version 0.6.0, \"firewalld\" has incorporated \"nftables\" as its
backend support. Utilizing the limit statement in \"nftables\" can help to
mitigate DoS attacks.
  "
  desc  'rationale', ''
  desc  'check', "
    Verify \"nftables\" is configured to allow rate limits on any connection to
the system with the following command:

    Verify \"firewalld\" has \"nftables\" set as the default backend:

    $ sudo grep -i firewallbackend /etc/firewalld/firewalld.conf

    # FirewallBackend
    FirewallBackend=nftables

    If the \"nftables\" is not set as the \"firewallbackend\" default, this is
a finding.
  "
  desc  'fix', "
    Configure \"nftables\" to be the default \"firewallbackend\" for
\"firewalld\" by adding or editing the following line in
\"etc/firewalld/firewalld.conf\":

    FirewallBackend=nftables

    Establish rate-limiting rules based on organization-defined types of DoS
attacks on impacted network interfaces.
