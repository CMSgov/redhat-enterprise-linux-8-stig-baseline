    Verify that a separate file system/partition has been created for the
system audit data path with the following command:

    Note: /var/log/audit is used as the example as it is a common location.

    $ sudo grep /var/log/audit /etc/fstab

    UUID=3645951a /var/log/audit xfs defaults 1 2

    If an entry for \"/var/log/audit\" does not exist, ask the System
Administrator if the system audit logs are being written to a different file
system/partition on the system, then grep for that file system/partition.

    If a separate file system/partition does not exist for the system audit
data path, this is a finding.
