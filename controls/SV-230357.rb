  title 'RHEL 8 must enforce password complexity by requiring that at least one
uppercase character be used.'
  desc 'Use of a complex password helps to increase the time and resources
required to compromise the password. Password complexity, or strength, is a
measure of the effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts at guessing
and brute-force attacks.

    Password complexity is one factor of several that determines how long it
takes to crack a password. The more complex the password, the greater the
number of possible combinations that need to be tested before the password is
compromised.

    RHEL 8 utilizes pwquality as a mechanism to enforce password complexity.
Note that in order to require uppercase characters, without degrading the
"minlen" value, the credit value must be expressed as a negative number in
"/etc/security/pwquality.conf".'
  desc 'check', 'Verify the value for "ucredit" with the following command:

$ sudo grep -r ucredit /etc/security/pwquality.conf*

/etc/security/pwquality.conf:ucredit = -1

If the value of "ucredit" is a positive number or is commented out, this is a finding.
If conflicting results are returned, this is a finding.'
  desc 'fix', 'Configure the operating system to enforce password complexity by requiring that at least one uppercase character be used by setting the "ucredit" option.

Add the following line to /etc/security/pwquality.conf (or modify the line to have the required value):

ucredit = -1

Remove any configurations that conflict with the above value.'
