  title "RHEL 8 must have the packages required for offloading audit logs
installed."
  desc  "Information stored in one location is vulnerable to accidental or
incidental deletion or alteration.

    Off-loading is a common process in information systems with limited audit
storage capacity.

    RHEL 8 installation media provides \"rsyslogd\".  \"rsyslogd\" is a system
utility providing support for message logging.  Support for both internet and
UNIX domain sockets enables this utility to support both local and remote
logging.  Couple this utility with \"gnutls\" (which is a secure communications
library implementing the SSL, TLS and DTLS protocols), and you have a method to
securely encrypt and off-load auditing.

    Rsyslog provides three ways to forward message: the traditional UDP
transport, which is extremely lossy but standard; the plain TCP based
transport, which loses messages only during certain situations but is widely
available; and the RELP transport, which does not lose messages but is
currently available only as part of the rsyslogd 3.15.0 and above.
    Examples of each configuration:
    UDP *.* @remotesystemname
    TCP *.* @@remotesystemname
    RELP *.* :omrelp:remotesystemname:2514
    Note that a port number was given as there is no standard port for RELP.

    Verify the operating system has the packages required for offloading audit
logs installed with the following commands:

    $ sudo yum list installed rsyslog

    rsyslog.x86_64          8.1911.0-3.el8          @AppStream

    If the \"rsyslog\" package is not installed, ask the administrator to
indicate how audit logs are being offloaded and what packages are installed to
support it.  If there is no evidence of audit logs being offloaded, this is a
finding.

    Configure the operating system to offload audit logs by installing the
required packages with the following command:

    $ sudo yum install rsyslog
