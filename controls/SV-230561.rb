default, functionality exceeding requirements or mission objectives. These
unnecessary capabilities or services are often overlooked and therefore may
remain unsecured. They increase the risk to the platform by providing
additional attack vectors.

    Operating systems are capable of providing a wide variety of functions and
services. Some of the functions and services, provided by default, may not be
necessary to support essential organizational operations (e.g., key missions,
functions).

    The tuned package contains a daemon that tunes the system settings
dynamically. It does so by monitoring the usage of several system components
periodically. Based on that information, components will then be put into lower
or higher power savings modes to adapt to the current usage. The tuned package
is not needed for normal OS operations.'
