network devices and information systems, which lack automated monitoring
capabilities, increase risk and make remote user access management difficult at
best.

    Remote access is access to DoD nonpublic information systems by an
authorized user (or an information system) communicating through an external,
non-organization-controlled network. Remote access methods include, for
example, dial-up, broadband, and wireless.

    Automated monitoring of remote access sessions allows organizations to
detect cyber attacks and ensure ongoing compliance with remote access policies
by auditing connection activities of remote access capabilities, such as Remote
Desktop Protocol (RDP), on a variety of information system components (e.g.,
servers, workstations, notebook computers, smartphones, and tablets).'

command:

    $ sudo grep -E '(auth.*|authpriv.*|daemon.*)' /etc/rsyslog.conf

logged, this is a finding.)
