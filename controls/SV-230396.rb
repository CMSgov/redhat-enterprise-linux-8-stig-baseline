the errors. Error messages are an indicator of an organization's operational
state or can identify the RHEL 8 system or platform. Additionally, Personally

    First, determine where the audit logs are stored with the following command:

    $ sudo grep -iw log_file /etc/audit/auditd.conf

    Using the location of the audit log file, check if the audit log has a mode
of "0600" or less permissive with the following command:

    If the audit log has a mode more permissive than "0600", this is a
