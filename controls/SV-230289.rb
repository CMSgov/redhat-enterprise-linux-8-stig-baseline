    Verify the SSH daemon performs compression after a user successfully
authenticates with the following command:

    $ sudo grep -i compression /etc/ssh/sshd_config

    Compression delayed

    If the \"Compression\" keyword is set to \"yes\", is missing, or the
returned line is commented out, this is a finding.
  "
  desc 'fix', "
    Uncomment the \"Compression\" keyword in \"/etc/ssh/sshd_config\" (this
file may be named differently or be in a different location if using a version
of SSH that is provided by a third-party vendor) on the system and set the
value to \"delayed\" or \"no\":

    Compression no

    The SSH service must be restarted for changes to take effect.
