  title "RHEL 8 must use cryptographic mechanisms to protect the integrity of
audit tools."
  desc  "Protecting the integrity of the tools used for auditing purposes is a
critical step toward ensuring the integrity of audit information. Audit
information includes all information (e.g., audit records, audit settings, and
audit reports) needed to successfully audit information system activity.

    Audit tools include, but are not limited to, vendor-provided and open
source audit tools needed to successfully view and manipulate audit information
system activity and records. Audit tools include custom queries and report
generators.

    It is not uncommon for attackers to replace the audit tools or inject code
into the existing tools with the purpose of providing the capability to hide or
erase system activity from the audit logs.

    To address this risk, audit tools must be cryptographically signed to
provide the capability to identify when the audit tools have been modified,
manipulated, or replaced. An example is a checksum hash of the file or files.

    Verify that Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment (AIDE) is properly
configured to use cryptographic mechanisms to protect the integrity of audit
tools.

    If AIDE is not installed, ask the System Administrator how file integrity
checks are performed on the system.

    Check the selection lines to ensure AIDE is configured to add/check with
the following command:

    $ sudo egrep '(\\/usr\\/sbin\\/(audit|au))' /etc/aide.conf

    /usr/sbin/auditctl p+i+n+u+g+s+b+acl+xattrs+sha512
    /usr/sbin/auditd p+i+n+u+g+s+b+acl+xattrs+sha512
    /usr/sbin/ausearch p+i+n+u+g+s+b+acl+xattrs+sha512
    /usr/sbin/aureport p+i+n+u+g+s+b+acl+xattrs+sha512
    /usr/sbin/autrace p+i+n+u+g+s+b+acl+xattrs+sha512
    /usr/sbin/rsyslogd p+i+n+u+g+s+b+acl+xattrs+sha512
    /usr/sbin/augenrules p+i+n+u+g+s+b+acl+xattrs+sha512

    If any of the audit tools listed above do not have an appropriate selection
line, ask the system administrator to indicate what cryptographic mechanisms
are being used to protect the integrity of the audit tools.  If there is no
evidence of integrity protection, this is a finding.
  "
  desc  'fix', "
    Add or update the following lines to \"/etc/aide.conf\", to protect the
integrity of the audit tools.
