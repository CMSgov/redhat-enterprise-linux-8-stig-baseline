default, functionality exceeding requirements or mission objectives. These
unnecessary capabilities or services are often overlooked and therefore may
remain unsecured. They increase the risk to the platform by providing
additional attack vectors.

    Operating systems are capable of providing a wide variety of functions and
services. Some of the functions and services, provided by default, may not be
necessary to support essential organizational operations (e.g., key missions,
functions).

    The rsh-server service provides an unencrypted remote access service that
does not provide for the confidentiality and integrity of user passwords or the
remote session and has very weak authentication.

    If a privileged user were to log on using this service, the privileged user
password could be compromised.'
