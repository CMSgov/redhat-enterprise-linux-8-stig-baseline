audit record."

if audit records do not contain enough information.

    At a minimum, the organization must audit the full-text recording of
privileged commands. The organization must maintain audit trails in sufficient
detail to reconstruct events to determine the cause and impact of compromise.
The "semanage" command is used to configure certain elements of SELinux
policy without requiring modification to or recompilation from policy sources.

    When a user logs on, the AUID is set to the UID of the account that is
being authenticated. Daemons are not user sessions and have the loginuid set to
"-1". The AUID representation is an unsigned 32-bit integer, which equals
"4294967295". The audit system interprets "-1", "4294967295", and
"unset" in the same way.'
