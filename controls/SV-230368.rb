  title "RHEL 8 passwords must be prohibited from reuse for a minimum of five
generations."
  desc  "Password complexity, or strength, is a measure of the effectiveness of
a password in resisting attempts at guessing and brute-force attacks. If the
information system or application allows the user to reuse their password
consecutively when that password has exceeded its defined lifetime, the end
result is a password that is not changed per policy requirements.

    RHEL 8 utilizes \"pwquality\" consecutively as a mechanism to enforce
password complexity. This is set in both:
    /etc/pam.d/password-auth
    /etc/pam.d/system-auth.

    Note that manual changes to the listed files may be overwritten by the
\"authselect\" program.

    Verify the operating system prohibits password reuse for a minimum of five
generations.

    Check for the value of the \"remember\" argument in
\"/etc/pam.d/system-auth\" and \"/etc/pam.d/password-auth\" with the following
command:

    $ sudo grep -i remember /etc/pam.d/system-auth /etc/pam.d/password-auth

    password required pam_pwhistory.so use_authtok remember=5 retry=3

    If the line containing \"pam_pwhistory.so\" does not have the \"remember\"
module argument set, is commented out, or the value of the \"remember\" module
argument is set to less than \"5\", this is a finding.
  "
  desc 'fix', "
    Configure the operating system to prohibit password reuse for a minimum of
five generations.

    Add the following line in \"/etc/pam.d/system-auth\" and
\"/etc/pam.d/password-auth\" (or modify the line to have the required value):

    password required pam_pwhistory.so use_authtok remember=5 retry=3
