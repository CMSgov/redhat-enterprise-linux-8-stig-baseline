  desc 'Information stored in one location is vulnerable to accidental or
incidental deletion or alteration.

    Off-loading is a common process in information systems with limited audit
storage capacity.

    RHEL 8 installation media provides "rsyslogd".  "rsyslogd" is a system
utility providing support for message logging.  Support for both internet and
UNIX domain sockets enables this utility to support both local and remote
logging.  Couple this utility with "gnutls" (which is a secure communications
library implementing the SSL, TLS and DTLS protocols), and you have a method to
securely encrypt and off-load auditing.'

$ sudo grep -i '$DefaultNetstreamDriver' /etc/rsyslog.conf /etc/rsyslog.d/*.conf

/etc/rsyslog.conf:$DefaultNetstreamDriver gtls

If the value of the "$DefaultNetstreamDriver" option is not set to "gtls" or the line is commented out, this is a finding.

$ sudo grep -i '$ActionSendStreamDriverMode' /etc/rsyslog.conf /etc/rsyslog.d/*.conf

/etc/rsyslog.conf:$ActionSendStreamDriverMode 1

If the value of the "$ActionSendStreamDriverMode" option is not set to "1" or the line is commented out, this is a finding.

If neither of the definitions above are set, ask the System Administrator to indicate how the audit logs are off-loaded to a different system or media.

If there is no evidence that the transfer of the audit logs being off-loaded to another system or media is encrypted, this is a finding.)
