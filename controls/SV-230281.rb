    Verify the operating system removes all software components after updated
versions have been installed.

    Check if YUM is configured to remove unneeded packages with the following
command:

    $ sudo grep -i clean_requirements_on_remove /etc/dnf/dnf.conf

    clean_requirements_on_remove=True

    If \"clean_requirements_on_remove\" is not set to either \"1\", \"True\",
or \"yes\", commented out, or is missing from \"/etc/dnf/dnf.conf\", this is a
finding.

  desc 'fix', "
    Configure the operating system to remove all software components after
updated versions have been installed.

    Set the \"clean_requirements_on_remove\" option to \"True\" in the
\"/etc/dnf/dnf.conf\" file:
