  title "RHEL 8 must automatically lock an account when #{input('unsuccessful_attempts')} unsuccessful
logon attempts occur."
  desc  "By limiting the number of failed logon attempts, the risk of
unauthorized system access via user password guessing, otherwise known as
brute-force attacks, is reduced. Limits are imposed by locking the account.

    RHEL 8 can utilize the \"pam_faillock.so\" for this purpose. Note that
manual changes to the listed files may be overwritten by the \"authselect\"
program.

    From \"Pam_Faillock\" man pages: Note that the default directory that
\"pam_faillock\" uses is usually cleared on system boot so the access will be
reenabled after system reboot. If that is undesirable a different tally
directory must be set with the \"dir\" option.

    Check that the system locks an account after #{input('unsuccessful_attempts')} unsuccessful logon
attempts with the following commands:

    Note: If the System Administrator demonstrates the use of an approved
centralized account management method that locks an account after #{input('unsuccessful_attempts')}
unsuccessful logon attempts within a period of #{input('fail_interval_mins')} minutes, this requirement is
not applicable.

    Note: This check applies to RHEL versions 8.0 and 8.1, if the system is
RHEL version 8.2 or newer, this check is not applicable.

    Configure the operating system to lock an account when #{input('unsuccessful_attempts')} unsuccessful
logon attempts occur.

    Add/Modify the appropriate sections of the \"/etc/pam.d/system-auth\" and
\"/etc/pam.d/password-auth\" files to match the following lines:

    auth required pam_faillock.so preauth dir=/var/log/faillock silent audit
deny=#{input('unsuccessful_attempts')} even_deny_root fail_interval=#{input('fail_interval')} unlock_time=#{input('unlock_time')}

    account required pam_faillock.so

    The \"sssd\" service must be restarted for the changes to take effect. To
restart the \"sssd\" service, run the following command:
