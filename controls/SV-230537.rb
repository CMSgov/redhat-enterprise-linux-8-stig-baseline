  desc 'Responding to broadcast ICMP echoes facilitates network mapping and
provides a vector for amplification attacks.

    There are notable differences between Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4)
and Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6). IPv6 does not implement the same method
of broadcast as IPv4. Instead, IPv6 uses multicast addressing to the all-hosts
multicast group. Refer to RFC4294 for an explanation of "IPv6 Node
Requirements", which resulted in this difference between IPv4 and IPv6.'
