  title "RHEL 8 account identifiers (individuals, groups, roles, and devices)
must be disabled after 35 days of inactivity."
  desc  "Inactive identifiers pose a risk to systems and applications because
attackers may exploit an inactive identifier and potentially obtain undetected
access to the system. Owners of inactive accounts will not notice if
unauthorized access to their user account has been obtained.

    RHEL 8 needs to track periods of inactivity and disable application
identifiers after 35 days of inactivity.

    Verify the account identifiers (individuals, groups, roles, and devices)
are disabled after 35 days of inactivity with the following command:

    Check the account inactivity value by performing the following command:

    $ sudo grep -i inactive /etc/default/useradd

    INACTIVE=35

    If \"INACTIVE\" is set to \"-1\", a value greater than \"35\", or is
commented out, this is a finding.
  "
  desc 'fix', "
    Configure RHEL 8 to disable account identifiers after 35 days of inactivity
after the password expiration.

    Run the following command to change the configuration for useradd:

    $ sudo useradd -D -f 35

    #{input('org_name')[:acronym]} recommendation is 35 days, but a lower value is acceptable. The value
\"-1\" will disable this feature, and \"0\" will disable the account
immediately after the password expires.
