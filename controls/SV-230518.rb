This option must be used for mounting any file system not containing approved
binary files, as they may be incompatible. Executing files from untrusted file
systems increases the opportunity for unprivileged users to attain unauthorized
administrative access.

block special devices. Executing character or block special devices from
untrusted file systems increases the opportunity for unprivileged users to
attain unauthorized administrative access.

    The "nosuid" mount option causes the system to not execute "setuid" and
"setgid" files with owner privileges. This option must be used for mounting
any file system not containing approved "setuid" and "setguid" files.
Executing files from untrusted file systems increases the opportunity for
